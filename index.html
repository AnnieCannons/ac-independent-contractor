				<h1>Personal Financial Management</h1>
			</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Key Principles</h2>
					<ol>
						<li class="fragment"><strong>Spend money mindfully.</strong> This means to think carefully about the ways that you are spending money and to stop, drop and think before you purchase something.</li>
						 <li class="fragment" style="color:#77A58F"><strong>Save money.</strong> This means that each month, for your own financial safety and wellbeing, it is incredibly important that you are saving some money. It does not need to be a large amount of money; it could be a couple of dollars.</li>
						 <li class="fragment"><strong>Use financial products safely.</strong> A financial product can be anything from a credit card to a checking account or a savings account. There are a ton of different products in the market, and you need to be able to make smart decisions so you are financially secure.</li>
					</ol>
				</section>
		 
				<section>
					<h2>Important Rules</h2>
					<p>The Pillars of Successful Financial Planning</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Pay yourself first. (Save 20% of your income.)</li>
						<li class="fragment">Spend less than you make.</li>
						<li class="fragment">Follow the 20/30/50 rule. Put 20% into savings, 30% toward your wants and desires, and 50% towards your needs.</li>
					</ul>

				<section>
					<h2>1099 Contractor</h2>
					<p>What is an independent contractor?</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Normally, employers file a <a href="https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/tax-tips/IRS-Tax-Forms/What-is-a-W-2-Form-/INF14812.html">W-2</a> form for you.</li>
						<li class="fragment">If you receive tax form 1099-MISC for services you provide to a client as an independent contractor and the annual payments you receive total $600 or more, your tax filings are different than when you only earn income as an employee.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
		 
				<section>
					<h2>1099 Contractor</h2>
					<p>Taking Deductions</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">As an independent contractor, you can claim deductions for certain kinds of expenses from what counts as your "taxable income".</li>
						<li class="fragment">The deductions may be for business expenses or certain kinds of living expenses, like your health insurance or glasses. </li>
						<li class="fragment">For example, the cost of sophisticated computer software is an ordinary and necessary expense for a freelance graphic designer. (Hiring a limousine is not.)</li>
						<li class="fragment">What about your rent? Phone bill?</li>
						<li class="fragment">Keep track!</li>
					 </ul>
				</section>
		 
				<section>
					 <h2>1099 Contractor</h2>
					 <p>Reporting Net Income and an Independent Contractor</p>
					 <ul>
						 <li class="fragment">You will file a (1) FORM 1040 and (2) "schedules" that detail certain expenses.</li>
						 <li class="fragment"> For example, on "Schedule C or "C-EZ", you will calculate your net profit by taking your total self-employment income, including any earnings not included on a 1099-MISC, and subtracting the deductible business expenses you incur.</li>
						 <li class="fragment">The final "net income" figure must be transferred to Form 1040 and combined with your other earnings to calculate your tax obligations.</li>
					 </ul>
				</section>
		 
				<section>
					<h2>1099 Contractor</h2>
					<p>Other things to keep in mind</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">You must pay Social Security and Medicare taxes ("Self-employment taxes").</li>
						<li class="fragment">You may have an obligation to make up to four estimated tax payments to the IRS during the year. The amount and frequency of your estimated payments depends on how much income you earn, the tax withheld from other employment income, and the method you choose to calculate your estimated taxes. Use <a href="https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/tax-tips/IRS-Tax-Forms/What-is-IRS-Form-1040-ES--Estimated-Tax-for-Individuals-/INF19507.html">Form 1040-ES</a> to figure out your estimated tax obligations.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
		 
				 <section>
				  <h2>Online Financial Tools</h2>
				  <ul>
					  <li class="fragment">Online banking</li>
					  <a href="https://www.mint.com/"><li class="fragment">Mint</li></a>
					  <a href="https://www.paypal.com/home"><li class="fragment">Paypal</li></a>
				  </ul>
				  <aside class="notes">Discuss role of Paypal in class with usertesting and other forms of payment. Help students set it up in class, if they have not already done so. Teacher demo both products.</aside>
				</section>

				</ul>	
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Don't waste money</h2>

			</section>

			<section>
					<h2>Expectations</h2>
					<ol>
							<li class="fragment">You will be paid according to your SOW, usually 50% up front and 50% when complete.  “Complete” means the site is live on the client’s domain, has been tested and is free of material bugs, and has been approved by the client.  Expect to make at least a few additional changes after the client’s review.</li>
							<li class="fragment">We let the client change their mind a reasonable number of times, but not forever.  If we ask you to make a change, it’s because we priced that change within the scope of the contract.</li>
